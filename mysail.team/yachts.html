			<h2>Save Time</h2>

		</div>

		<div class="benefits-green">

			<h2>Improve Communication</h2>

			<p>Easily communicate with your entire crew or individual members with social messaging.</p>

			<p>See who's viewed messages and keep crew accountable with a messaging function visible to the entire crew, or easily send individual messages with the push of a button.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="clearfix"></div>

		<div class="benefits-white">

			<h2>Eliminate Frustrations</h2>

			<p>Reduce time spent chasing crew with automated communication.</p>

			<p>If a crewmember hasn't responded in the allocated time, Mysail will automatically send them a reminder to respond. In the lead-up to race day, all participating crew will get an automatic reminder with any important race-day details.</p>

		</div> 

		<div class="benefits-blue">

			<h2>Gain Visibility</h2>

			<p>Quickly view crew commitments, positions and availability in the calendar view.</p>

			<p>Easily see if you are short crew for a race and find out who else is available with the required skills. If you don't have any available crewmembers in your roster to fill the position, you can search for available crew matching your needs with the push of a button.</p>

		<div class="clearfix"></div>

		<div class="benefits-green">

			<h2>Find Crew</h2>

			<p>Never sail short-handed again (unless, of course, you want to), by easily connecting with new sailors matched to the needs of your yacht.</p>

			<p>If you're looking for new crewmembers for an individual race or on an ongoing basis, Mysail will match you with crewmembers based on your commitment, social and skill requirements. By promoting your yacht and advertising positions, crew can even come to you!</p>

		</div>

		<div class="benefits-white">

			<h2>Gain Confidence</h2>

			<p>Reduce uncertainty of taking new crew members on-board with ratings and reviews.</p>

			<p>See how crew have performed in the past and find out their skill level for each position with our simple and intuitive rating and review system. You can leave a review for all new sailors that come on-board, and they can do the same for you, helping to promote your yacht to new potential crewmembers.</p>
